The ‘Scarlet Pimpernel’ is the name used by Sir Percy Blakeney, an Englishman who uses many clever  disguises  (=ways of changing your clothes and appearance so that people do not recognize you) in order to help French people from a high social class to escape from France, and from the possibility of having their heads cut off by the  guillotine during the  French Revolution. There is a well-known short poem about him, which begins with the words ‘They seek him here, they seek him there...’, and is about how difficult it is to find the Scarlet Pimpernel."}
